# shecodes-registration-app
SheCodes Registration System
Practice project for learning Java, inheritance, and user interaction via console. A console-based Java app for managing alumni and mentors in a SheCodes-style community.

This is a simple Java-based console application that simulates a registration and login system for a community of alumni and mentors (e.g., SheCodes graduates).  
The project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming in Java, including inheritance, user interaction, and simple logic handling.

💡 Features

- Registration of new users (Alumni and Mentors)
- Login with password authentication
- User menu for:
  - Updating username
  - Changing password
  - Adding courses to resume
  - Updating job status
  - Checking mentoring eligibility (for Mentors)

🛠 Technologies

- Java (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Console I/O using Scanner
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Use of interfaces (functionalities)

📁 Project Structure

- RegisterApp.java: Main class that runs the application
- Alumni.java: Base class for alumni users
- Mentors.java: Subclass of Alumni with additional mentor-specific functionality
- functionalities.java: Interface that defines shared behaviors

🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ / Eclipse)
3. Run the RegisterApp class
4. Follow the console instructions

📌 Notes

- This is an early-stage project for learning purposes.
- Future improvements may include:
  - Data persistence (e.g., saving users to a file)
  - Input validation
  - GUI or web interface
